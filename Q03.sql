#3. What are the order ids of the orders that ordered "Sasquatch Ale"?  HINT:   Find 
#	the product id of "Sasquatch Ale" in a subquery and then use that value to find 
#	the matching orders from the `order details` table.  Because the `order details` 
#	table has a space in its name, you will need to surround it with back ticks in the 
#	FROM clause. 

SELECT OrderID FROM `order details`
WHERE ProductID = (SELECT ProductID FROM products
					WHERE ProductName = "Sasquatch Ale")
